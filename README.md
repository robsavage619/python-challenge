PyBank/PyPoll Activities

The code being deployed in the respective files takes on different responsibilities.

PyBank: the goal was to create a program that runs through the given CSV to determine the following information:

  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll: the goal was to create a program that runs through the a much larger CSV to determine the following information and showcase the effectiveness of Python in relation to Excel:

  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
Each program also produces a respective text file with the results of the code.

Built with: Python 3.6
